# PixelSim
PixelSim (working title) is an ambitious project aimed to sync a full cellular automata pixel simulation over the network in real-time, with rigidbodies supported.
The project is heavily inspired by existing titles such as Noita, Terraria, and Starbound.

It is currently in its infant stages.
